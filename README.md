# Poke-Game-v1
I'm following this tutorial online and have been tweaking as I see fit to make it better. I'm at about 2:47:00.

I can fix the character being off to the side but as you'll see via the vid, I want my collision blocks to animate (i.e. make boundaries). 
When I follow his steps around that point in the video and refresh on my browser, it goes blank. I don't know if it's the loading order or what.

I just don't know where I messed up. There are no detected errors, I've tried debugging, etc. Feelin defeated mane :-/
